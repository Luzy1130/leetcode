 * Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no
 * cycle, return null.
 * 
 * To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer pos which
 * represents the position (0-indexed)Â in the linked list where tail connects
 * to. If pos is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list.
 * 
 * Note: Do not modify the linked list.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
 * Output: tail connects to node index 1
 * Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the
 * second node.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
 * Output: tail connects to node index 0
 * Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the
 * first node.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: head = [1], pos = -1
 * Output: no cycle
 * Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
 *

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Follow-up:
 * Can you solve it without using extra space?

// Suppose,
// Length of cycle, C = 8
// Length of non cycle part of list, M = 3
// When slow enters first node of cycle, dist bw slow and fast is D = 3.
// Now, fast has to catch up slow with 2x speed. I.E relative to slow, fast has to travel C-D = 5, nodes. Since, fast is 2x of slow and relative to slow it travels 5 nodes, so originally it will need to travel 2*(C-D) nodes and slow need to travel (C-D) nodes for them to meet.

// image
// It is easy to point out that D is equal to Length of non cycle part of list, M.

// image

// At meeting point C-D (slow has to travel C-D nodes to meet), slow is D nodes away from cycle starting.
// Since D = M, slow is M nodes away from cycly starting point. So is the head pointer. If they both move one node at a time, they will meet at cycle starting point.
